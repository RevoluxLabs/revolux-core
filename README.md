# Revolux-Core (RVLX)

Revolux-Core is the reference implementation of the Revolux blockchain protocol.

Revolux-Core is an independent Layer-1 blockchain implementation focused on fair launch, strong default privacy, 
and protocol-level auditability.


This repository contains the node (daemon), wallet software, and supporting
tooling used to operate the Revolux network.
